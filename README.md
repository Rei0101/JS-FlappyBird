2. A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that must be executed in Google Colab

Please follow the steps below for each part.

## Running the JS web game

This is probably easiest with the Live server extension so that is the way mentioned here but there are other ways.

### Requirements
- Visual Studio Code
- Live Server VS Code extension

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>

2. Open the project folder in VS Code

3. Install the Live Server extension (if not already installed)

4. Locate the main HTML file (e.g. index.html)

5. Right-click the file and select “Open with Live Server”

6. The game will automatically open in your browser (usually at http://127.0.0.1:5500)
